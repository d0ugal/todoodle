# todoodle

A super simple todo API. Primarily built for use with Home Assistant.

This allows your automations to create and clear tasks automatically. Then you
can get reminders about outstanding tasks.

For example, do you monitor plants? A new task can be created when the moisture 
is too low and then it can be cleared once you water them. You can then setup
reminders to make sure you don't neglect your plants.
